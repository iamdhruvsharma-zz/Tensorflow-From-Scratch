Introduction to TensorFlow! 

Consider using Google Colab for running the mentioned notebooks.
1. MNIST classification using Linear Models 
2. MNIST classification using TensorFlow (My First Time! :) )
3. MNIST classification using Keras (Much Easier) [Consider this link: https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html ]
